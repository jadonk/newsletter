 title: Enabling Success
 body: <p><b>Eureka!</b> Εύρηκα, in Greek, is an exclamation we often use to celebrate the success of a discovery or invention. Its first use is attributed to ancient Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes.</p><p>One of the greatest feelings an inventor can experience is that moment when something works, when the code is de-bugged, when the pieces come together. Enabling success, supporting invention, and encouraging entrepreneurship is the foundation of the BeagleBoard.org community. Open Source hardware and software is by its very nature a place for creativity to blossom into successful invention.</p><p>We’ve just returned from <a href="https://beagleboard.org/blog/2018-10-18-empowering-innovative-education-celebrating-community-maker-faire-nyc">Maker Faire New York</a>, a great place to interact with creative inventors and educators of all ages, backgrounds, and experience levels. In this month’s dish, learn more about community members who have taken their ideas to great heights, like the <a href="https://beagleboard.org/p/bigjosh/three-story-tall-clock-final-entry-5ab263">three story tall clock</a>, or around the world, like the successful <a href="https://beagleboard.org/blog/2018-10-22-poursteady">coffee equipment company</a> who got their start at a Maker Faire. We celebrate these, and also that spark when a student shouts “Eureka!” after lighting their first LED.<br />As part of our continued celebration of the BeagleBoard.org 10 year anniversary, we’d love to publish your success story. Email us at <a href="christi@beagleboard.org">christi@beagleboard.org</a> with your story and a link to your project or product.<br>&mdash;<strong>Christine Long</strong>, <em>Executive Director</em></p>
