 title: Expanding Horizons!
 body: </p>Artificial Intelligence applications like machine learning, knowledge reasoning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics are growing exponentially and are a natural fit for the goals of BeagleBoard.org®. We are excited to share a sneak peek of our new <a href="https://beagleboard.org/ai">BeagleBone® AI</a> with you.   Based on a very powerful new processor, it’s received tremendous feedback from the community at Embedded World and Maker Faire.  This affirms our goals to educate and enable creativity in AI the same way we have with embedded Linux - to make low cost, friendly to use, open source hardware and software available to anyone - expanding horizons from Kindergarten to Rocket Science.<br>&mdash;<strong>Christine Long</strong>, <em>Executive Director</em></p>
