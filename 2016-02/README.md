# featured projects

* OpenTAC
  * http://wiki.vero-apparatus.com/OpenTAC
  * tip from Vladimir Pantelic
  * Open hardware Test Automation Controller.
  * ARM device running Debian to automate tests on 4 to 8 devices, initially aimed at LAVA support for Linaro engineers.
  * Power distribution server, serial console server, network switch and optional GPIO extensions with simple telnet control interfaces. 

* Bela: The embedded platform for ultra-low latency audio
  * http://bela.io
  * BeagleBone Black cape with stereo audio in/out, 8 channels each of 16-bit, DC-coupled analog I/O, and 16 GPIO pins
  * uses Xenomai Linux to run audio and sensor code at nearly bare metal priority, which means that you can use buffer sizes as small as 2 audio samples and achieve latencies under 1ms
  * "best of both worlds: the connectivity of a Linux machine with the timing precision of a microcontroller"
  * Augmented Instruments Laboratory, part of the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London
  * open-source project designed for creating self-contained musical instruments and interactive audio systems. It's got a
  * browser-based IDE (all compiling done on the board) with an in-broswer oscilloscope.
  * paper with some more info and performance metrics: http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/mcpherson_aes2015.pdf
  * code and hardware designs: http://bela.io/code
