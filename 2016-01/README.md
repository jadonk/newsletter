## 32C3: BEYOND YOUR CABLE MODEM
* http://hackaday.com/2015/12/29/32c3-beyond-your-cable-modem/
> There’s even a bone for you die-hard hardware hackers out there who think that all of this software security stuff is silly. To get the modem’s firmware in the first place, at minute 42 of the talk, [Alexander] shows briefly how he pulled the flash chip off the device and read it into his computer using a BeagleBone Black. No JTAG, no nothing. Just pulling the chip off and reading it the old-fashioned way.

  * Hunyue Yau of H-Y Research
  > One of the values of Linux on the BeagleBoards is being able to leverage existing Linux software. However, an alarming tread on support lists, tutorials, and projects is devaluating Linux possibly without even users being aware of it. Let's briefly look at some common problems.
* BeagleBone patchset for mainline Linux kernel
  * http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone/blog/2015/12/05/mainline-linux-kernel-on-beaglebone-black
  * Posted by Drew Fustini: "After my last post Build fbtft drivers for Linux 4.4 on BeagleBone Black, I was curious what patches are needed to run mainline Linux kernel on BeagleBone Black.  Here's what I've found so far:"

* Robert C. Nelson: 4.4-lts plans (4.1-lts not going away)
  * https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beagleboard/T3lx6CQ4cXY/0q9z5C-8CQAJ
  * We are about a week away from, 4.4.0 lts being released.  (4.4.0-rc8 is still being built for every distro on the farm).. 
  * I just want to ping and remind everyone with my plans. 
  * I'd like to keep "4.1.x" going till the 4.(4+next) lts release... 
* Robert C. Nelson: 4.1 repo
  * https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beagleboard/TMGEWjBLsok/StLZ7lvUmRYJ
  * Just a heads up, the 4.1 branch:
  * https://github.com/beagleboard/linux/tree/4.1
  * Is now based on ti's 4.1.x-ti release. (same thing we did with 3.14.x)
  * http://git.ti.com/gitweb/?p=ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/ti-linux-4.1.y

  * https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beagleboard/9tuyf1_-vz0/cHhWYcPcDAAJ
  * I just opened up the 4.4 branch on https://github.com/beagleboard/linux/
  * https://github.com/beagleboard/linux/tree/4.4
  * It boots just fine on my bbb..
  * We still recommend everyone use the "4.1" branch..
  * But there's no reason to not start looking at 4.4
  * https://github.com/beagleboard/bb.org-overlays/ will support "BOTH" 4.1 & 4.4 branches
